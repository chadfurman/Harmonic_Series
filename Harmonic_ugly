#The idea of this one is to prompt the user if the calculations are taking a while.
#I want it to ask for permission before just invisibly and indefinitely running.
#This is because by the nature of the calculations, it slows down on numbers larger than 17.
#10 million calculations take about 30 seconds. So it is supposed to pay attention to how high
#the counter gets, then stop and ask, "this might take a while, continue?" to let you decide
if you want to possibly wait a long time.
#I set the cutoff very low for testing. Use numbers above 6 to see if it works properly with the 
#continue? prompt. Use numbers below 5 to see if it works without hitting the continue? prompt.
#You'll see that as it is now, it prompts continue? no matter what, and doesn't give the correct answer.
#Correct answers should be 1, 4, 11, 31, 83, 227, 616. Similar attempts to implement this sort of thing
#have resulted in it giving the correct answer, but not stopping to prompt.
#I have developed a different approach to addressing the slow calculation problem, which I implemented
#in Harmonic_celestial. But I'm presenting Harmonic_ugly here because the fact it doesn't do what I expect
#means there are still concepts I'm not clear on. The only reason to fix this code is so I can learn the 
#concepts that are escaping me. In particular, I don't understand what happens when a while loop is satisfied.
#I have two while loops, one right after the other, but the first one completes and provides its output (101),
#and though the prompt from the second while loop appears (whether the first while loop completed or not),
#I don't think the second while loop does any calculations.
