# Harmonic_Series

Welcome to the first README I've ever written!

These programs accept a whole number input by the user, then add up consecutive reciprocals (1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.) until their sum exceeds the value of that whole number. Then it tells you how many reciprocals needed to be added.

Harmonic_Series: A clean, functional version that displays nicely and prompts for the next input.

Harmonic_good: The clean, working version Red guided me through.

Harmonic_bad: My first attempt at making it work.

Harmonic_ugly: My first attempt at making a version that asks for permission before hanging forever while doing billions of calculations.

Harmonic_celestial: My second attempt at making a version that gives the user some clue of how long calculations take. Much cleaner. Outputs as a series of items. I'm trying to get it to time stamp each output or state how long it took to calculate each output.

I want my first README to have a little more pizazz, so here's a joke:

A software developer was at work at 5:30 am when his boss walked in.

He had been there all night, and when his boss arrived, he was muttering angrily to himself, smacking his desk and swearing every few seconds.

The boss asks him what's wrong.

The developer replies, "It's this language I'm trying to code in, sir. The simplest statements take at least twenty lines of code, it has no standard libraries, it auto-compiles every five minutes, it requires special characters I have to copy-paste, it exits loops in the wrong place on Thursdays, and if you get a segfault, it displays a quote from the Third Reich."

His boss asks, "Well, why don't you use a different language, then?"

The developer replies, "The other languages suck."
